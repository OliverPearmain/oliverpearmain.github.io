I posted the [Unboxing of Octava 4×4 HDMI Matrix Switch (HDMX44CAT-UK)]({% post_url 2011-02-04-Unboxing-of-Octava-4x4-HDMI-Matrix-Switch-(HDMX44CAT-UK) %}) a while back having just taken delivery of the Octava unit.

Anyways, having owned and tried using the box for a over a month I am disappointed to report that I have returned it. The matrix gave me a host of problems, some of which I overcame with some rigorous trial and error techniques, others of which I wasn’t so lucky.

My full experience is documented over at AVForums in my [Experiences with Octava 4×4 HDMI CAT6 Matrix Switch (HDMX44CAT-UK)](http://www.avforums.com/forums/hdmi-cables-switches/1406492-experiences-octava-4x4-hdmi-cat6-matrix-switch-hdmx44cat-uk.html){: target="_blank" } thread. It is a bit of a long read so to summarise the final list of the unresolved issues that I experienced with the Octava matrix are as follows…

- No sound on Sharp TV, regardless of EDID mode (unless I performed a complex cable swap, to force HDMI handshake, with every matrix reboot)
- REVO/XBMC/HTPC would frequently get “lost” (no picture/sound routed to any receiver) by the matrix (when being brought out of standby normally). The only way to fix was to reboot both the REVO and the matrix
- Certain sources (Xbox 360) not automatically detecting sink device as 1080P capable (wasn’t a immediate problem since I can manually force the source to do 1080P but could see issues going forward if I were to add other source devices that don’t have the appropriate settings)
- Intermittent IR issues (I put this down to interference being emitted from my Samsung TV however when trying to debug the issue I found that pulling the IR cable out of one of the extenders would cause all IR to stop working all together from any extender, very strange, there seems to me there’s way to much ‘dependency’ in the matrix)

I am however pleased to report that I have recently taken delivery of a [HD Anywhere 4×4 matrix]({% post_url 2011-05-04-Unboxing-of-HD-Anywhere-4x4-HDMI-CAT-5-6-Matrix Switch-(aka-Grandbeing-MX0404-323) %}) and so far this works almost flawlessly out of the box. I am still testing however and will report more soon.
